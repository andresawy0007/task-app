# General considerations

This project was developed using Laravel 11 and DDEV as the local development environment. To set it up, I recommend using DDEV and running the following commands:
## 1. Configure the project
```
ddev config --project-type=laravel --docroot=public --create-docroot
```
## 2. Start the DDEV environment
```
ddev start
```
## 3. Launch the project in your browser
```
ddev launch
```
## 4. Prepare the database
```
ddev artisan migrate
ddev artisan db:seed
```

And thatâ€™s it! ðŸš€ Your Laravel project should now be ready to use.
